I am Ziming You, a Master’s student in the [School of Software & Microelectronics](https://www.ss.pku.edu.cn/) at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), currently in my second year. I graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from [Beihang University](https://buaa.edu.cn/) in 2022. My Master’s advisor is [Yu Huang](https://group.pku.edu.cn/hy/zh_CN/index.htm). My research interests include agents, multi-agent systems, and alignment. I am currently applying for a Ph.D. program.

I have experience working as a Large Language Model Algorithm Engineering Intern at [ModelBest](https://modelbest.cn/) (May 2023 - October 2023) and as a Research Intern at [THUNLP](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/) (November 2023 - present, transitioning to remote work in March 2024), where my research focus is on multi-agent systems.
