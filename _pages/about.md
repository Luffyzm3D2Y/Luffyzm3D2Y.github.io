Hi there! I'm Ziming You, a Master's student at my final year from Peking University (M.Eng. Program), majoring in Software Engineering. I graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Technology from Beihang University in 2022. Currently I'm working as a research intern at [THUNLP](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/), supervised by [Zhiyuan Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dT0v5u0AAAAJ&hl=en).

**Research Interests**
My research interests mainly focus on Natural Language Processing, especially **Large Language Models(LLMs) and their applications, including LLM/VLM Agent, Multi-Agent System, Post-training techniques (i.e. reinforcement learning for LLM reasoning).**

Currently I'm working on reinforcement learning for reasoning with large language models (LLMs). Moving forward, I’m particularly interested in the following research problems:

-	At the model level: **How can we train more capable LLM/VLM-based agents via reinforcement learning? This involves challenges such as environment construction, training paradigms, evaluation frameworks, and more.**
-	At the agent architecture level: **What principles can we meaningfully borrow from cognitive science and traditional agent designs to build more effective and generalizable agents?**
