Hi there! I'm Ziming You, a Master's student at my final year from Peking University (M.Eng. Program), majoring in Software Engineering. I graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Technology from Beihang University in 2022. Currently I'm working as a research intern at [THUNLP](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/), supervised by [Zhiyuan Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dT0v5u0AAAAJ&hl=en).

**Research Interests**
My research interests mainly focus on Natural Language Processing, especially Large Language Models(LLMs) and their applications, including LLM/VLM Agent, Multi-Agent System, Post-training techniques (i.e. reinforcement learning for LLM reasoning).

Currently I'm working on reinforcement learning for reasoning with large language models (LLMs). Moving forward, I’m particularly interested in the following research problems:

- At the model level: **How to train more capable LLM/VLM-based agents via reinforcement learning? It involves environment construction, training recipe, evaluation and so on.**


- At the agent architecture level: **What can we really borrow from cognitive science and traditional agent architectures to build more effective and generalizable agents?**
